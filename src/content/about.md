I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. **I am recruiting Ph.D. students for Fall 2023.** If you are a prospective graduate student or postdoc, please feel free to get in touch! 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] (supervised by [Jeff Bigham][jeff]) and a Research Scientist at [Apple][apple]. I received my PhD from the department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science][eecs] at [UC Berkeley][berkeley], advised by professors [Björn Hartmann][bjoern] at UC Berkeley and [Maneesh Agrawala][maneesh] at Stanford. My PhD work was supported by an [NDSEG fellowship][NDSEGgeneral], a departmental Excellence Award, and a Sandisk Fellowship.

I regularly teach a Computer Science class covers the design and development of user interfaces (Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction). Prior versions of this class include [CS160 at UC Berkeley in Summer 2018][coursewebsite] and [CS378 at UT Austin in Fall 2021][coursewebsiteut].
